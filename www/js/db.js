	1:"Select a variety of flowering crabapple that's resistant to the apple scab fungus. Red-flowering varieties, such as \"Cardinal,\" \"Prairifire,\" \"Purple Prince\" and \"Royal Raindrops,\" are all rated as having excellent resistance to apple scab by J. Frank Schmidt & Son.\n\
		Apply a foliar spray of zinc sulfate and urea in the fall. This spray forces the tree to drop its leaves quickly and causes rapid decomposition of the leaf litter.",
	2:"1. Identify the affected plant. Black rot is a common disease of apple trees, grapevines, and crucifer crops such as cabbage, broccoli, radish and turnip.\
\
2. Assess the plant's symptoms to confirm the presence of black rot. On crucifers, the bacterial infection Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris appears as \"V\" shaped yellow spots on leaves that progress into yellow slime and brown spots on stems. On apple trees, fungal infection Boytryosphaeria obtusa causes purple leaf spots, brown leaf centers, fruit rot and branch cankers. On grapes, the fungus Guignardia bidwellii causes yellow leaf spots, black leaf edges, brown leaf centers, stem lesions and fruit rot.\
\
3. Weed regularly to improve air circulation and light access around all plants affected by black rot. Remove all dead plant material from the area, placing it into plastic trash bags to prevent further spread of the disease.\
\
4. Prune the dead or infected branches from apple trees and grapevines, disinfecting the pruning shears with a 70 percent alcohol solution after each cut. Also improve circulation in the center of the plant by pruning away congested branches.\
\
5. Pluck all mummified fruit from apple trees and grapevines as soon as possible, as these house fungal spores and cause the disease to spread. Dispose of the fruit in plastic trash bags.\
\
6. Rotate crucifer crops every two years, using black rot-resistant cultivars. When replanting, soak seeds in hot water to kill black rot and wait until a warm, dry day to sow the seeds.\
\
7. Treat stubborn grapevine and apple infections with a commercial fungicide containing captan once the year's new growth reaches 4 to 6 inches in length. Add 1 tablespoon of captan fungicide to a gallon of water and mix it thoroughly in a hand sprayer tank. Pumping the handle, coat the branches and leaves completely. Repeat the application once every 7 to 10 days until the fruit begins to change color.",
	3:"1. Look for for galls and small yellow spots on the leaves, two primary symptoms of cedar-apple disease. Galls, which appear on the branch tips, are comprised of rough, coarse wood, have a bulbous shape, and range from three-eighths inch to over 1 inch in diameter.\
\
2. Sever affected branches 2 inches from the gall with bypass pruners or long-reach pruners using a clean straight cut. Allow the healthy portion of the branch to remain intact and attached to the tree.\
\
3. Apply contact fungicide to trees in close proximity to the infected cedar according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Look for the active ingredient potassium bicarbonate, approved in California for contact fungicide. Spray the trees, including trunk, branches and foliage, when you see yellow spots on the leaves, which often occurs in mid-April.\
\
4. Apply systemic fungicide, which is absorbed through capillary action and travels throughout the tree. Look for the active ingredients tebuconazole and fluopyram or fludioxonil andcyprodinil. Spray the trunk, branches and foliage according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.",
	4:"1 . Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.\
\
2. Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground.\
\
3. Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves.\
\
4. Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days.\
\
5. Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors.\
\
6. Water in the morning, so plants have a chance to dry during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses will help keep the foliage dry.\
\
7. Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible.\
\
8. Destroy all plant debris after harvest.Do NOT compost.\
\
9. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.",
	5:"1. The most proficient and economical method to reduce yield losses from corn grey leaf spot is by introducing resistant plant varieties. Lesions on resistant hybrids are smaller and the disease develops more slowly than on susceptible hybrids \
\
2. Rotating away from corn may help reduce local levels of inoculum and reduce Gray leaf spot severity in the following corn crop. \
\
3. Practices that promote the decomposition of corn residue will greatly reduce the amount of the fungus present to cause disease [6].  Burying residue as little as 10-cm below the surface can greatly reduce primary infection levels.\
\
4. There are numerous fungicides available for control of Gray leaf spot. If at least 50% of plants in a field have disease present on the third leaf below the ear leaf or higher prior to tasseling, the hybrid is susceptible, and the conditions are favorable for disease, then a spray may be warranted.",
	6:"1. Scout for fungal leaf diseases 2 weeks before tasseling to 2 weeks after tasseling.\
\
2. At that point, at least a 15% whole-plant infection is needed to justify a fungicide treatment.\
\
3. Consider the below factors for decision on fungicide treatment\
3.1 First, consider the weather. Fungi in general and rusts in particular need free water (on the leaves) and continued wet weather to continue to flourish.\
3.2 Next, consider the probability of other fungal leaf blights developing in the field and in your particular hybrid. Cropping history and corn residue levels can affect development of diseases\
3.3 Consider the price of corn and cost per application.\
\
4. Timely foliar fungicide applications can help reduce leaf damage due to common  rust.\
4.1 For aerial applications, a minimum of 5 gal/acre of water should be used. \
4.2 For ground application, use a minimum of 20 gal/acre of water and hollow cone nozzles with spray pressure of at least 30 to 40 psi.",
